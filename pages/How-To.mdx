# Basic Commands

## frate new

The frate new command will help you initialize a new project

```bash
frate new /path/to/project
```
if you don't want to be prompted for values,
you can use default values
```bash
frate new -d /path/to/project
```

## frate run
To run your newly created program

```bash
frate run
```
---

## frate add

in frate we use frate [action] [state] to modify things
so to add a package to your project we can say

#### add a package
```bash
frate add package SDL2
```

or

```bash
frate add p cxxopts
```

#### add a compile mode

here we are adding a define macro for you

```cpp
#ifdef DEBUG
  std::cout <<  "I will only run in debug mode" << std::endl;
#endif
```

The default modes are Debug, Test and Release, so you don't  have to add these


```bash
frate add mode SpecialMode 
```


## frate remove

similar to add, we can remove packages, modes, and it works on the same principle of 

frate [action] [state]

#### remove a package
```bash
frate remove package SDL2
frate rm p SDL2
```

#### remove a compile mode
```bash
frate remove mode SpecialMode
```

## frate list

#### list packages
to list all the installed packages 
```bash
frate list packages
```

#### list modes
to list all of the compile modes available
```bash
frate list modes
```
