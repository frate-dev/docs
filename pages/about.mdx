# About

## What is Frate? 

Frate is a CLI tool that allows you to easily create a new project from a template. We manage dependencies, so you can focus on what matters.
Cross compilation is also supported, so you can build your project for multiple platforms with a single command.

## Project Goals
C/C++ projects *should* have a build system that just works. Frate is a tool that aims to achieve this goal.

We just want to provide 
- Sane defaults
- Easily Extentible
- Cross Compilation (withouth the hassle)
- Faster Shared Builds (Remote Builds w/ Remote Objectfile Cache)
